# life_expectancy
final project for my stat learning class - first find a model than can accurately predict life expectancy, and then find a model that is easily interpretable. also just use a lot of the approaches i learned about, and see if the results make sense given what I know about the data. 

data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lashagoch/life-expectancy-who-updated or https://doi.org/10.34740/KAGGLE/DS/3065197
  - see link(s) for explanations of what each variable is
  - i downloaded and renamed it to LifeExpectancy.csv, and added to the folder that RStudio opens in
  - if you do something else, you'll need to modify the line where I read it in

packages used: glmnet, tidyverse, pls, reshape2, randomForest, caret, tree, car
